Install old slimjet v10 with Java and NPAPI support:


"Support of Java and NPAPI will be discontinued in Slimjet 11
Due to the efforts required to continue support of Java and NPAPI, and
considering the small percentage of users who actually need this, we plan to
discontinue support of Java and NPAPI in Slimjet 11 (based on Chromium 51)."
--Slimjet Developer's Blog
  http://www.slimjet.com/blog/support-of-java-and-npapi-will-be-discontinued-in-slimjet-11/


"Unfortunately, we only started to archive old versions of Chrome since Chrome  
48.  Chrome dropped support for Java, silverlight and other NPAPI plugins in 
Chrome 45.  If you are looking for an old version of Chrome with support of 
Java, silverlight or other NPAPI plugins, we'd recommend Slimjet Web Browser, 
which is based on Chromium and retains support of Java, silverlight and other 
NPAPI plugins."

1. Download Slimjet Web Browser 64bit Deb Package(.deb);

On Slimjet Web Browser page (http://www.slimjet.com/en/dlpage.php)

Manually Install Cisco WebEx for Google Chrome   <===
==============================================
Document created by Cisco Documentation Team on Jun 7, 2016

This document contains instructions on how to manually install the Cisco WebEx
meeting extension in Google Chrome.

To manually install the WebEx meeting extension in Chrome:
1. Download the archive: Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx.zip (see link below).[1]

$ wget https://help.webex.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/\
8412-102-1-27331/Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx.zip

2. Locate the downloaded zip file and open it. Save the WebEx extension file
   Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx to your desktop or other convenient location.

$ unzip Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx.zip
Archive:  Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx.zip
  inflating: Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx  
$

3. Open a new tab in Chrome and type "chrome://extensions" in the Address Bar
   and press Enter.

4. Drag the extension file Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx into the Extensions tab
   in Chrome.

Drag Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx to Extensions tab in
chrome v52.0.2743.82 (64-bit) on covellite debian 8.6 amd64 GCI Network 
Services, OSS workstation.

At Extensions, apps, and themes can harm your computer. Are you sure want to
continue?

click CONTINUE

Get Error:
  At Apps, extensions, and user scripts cannot be added from this website
  click OK

  "Instead of opening the file, you have to: extract it (crx are zip files),
  then visit chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, and load unpacked
  extension.

  The reason for this is: lots of people try to abuse chrome apps/extensions
  to install nasty applications to your browser.  So Chrome tries to make it
  impossible to automatically side-load these apps without you making sure
  that is really what you want to do.
  
  So.. typical caveats of installing software apply when using this approach."

Hence:
  i.   Open a new tab in Chrome and type "chrome://extensions" in the
       Address Bar

  ii.  At Extensions
       x Developer mode

  iii. Drag Cisco_WebEx_Extension.crx into the Extensions tab
       in Chrome.
       watch Drop to install popup

  iv.  In Extension see:
       Cisco WebEx Extension 1.0.1
       Join WebEx meetings using Google Chrome
       ID: jlhmfgmfgeifomenelglieieghnjghma

  v.   Test new extension at:
       https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html
       Name:          Ray
       Email Address: rmarcil@gci.com

       click Test a Meeting

       Arg... Still get java error.

5. Select Add extension.

Note: Your computer may still have to automatically download and install a
Cisco WebEx add-on file when you first join a meeting.

You can now join your meeting.

Google Chrome
=============
*Using WebEx on Chrome
Because Chrome will be removing support for NPAPI, a new joining method using
a Chrome extension has been provided for using WebEx starting with Chrome 38.
When using WebEx for the first time on Chrome, users will be guided through a
one-time process to add the extension and update the WebEx application.  After
the first time, users can join without the extra steps.
--Ex Meetings supports Windows, Mac, Linux Operating Systems.
  https://www.webex.co.uk/support/support-system-requirements.html


Chrome no longer supports NPAPI (technology required for Java applets)
The Java plug-in for web browsers relies on the cross platform plugin
architecture NPAPI, which has been supported by all major web browsers
for over a decade.  Google's Chrome version 45 (scheduled for release
in September 2015) drops support for NPAPI, impacting plugins for
Silverlight, Java, Facebook Video and other similar NPAPI based
plugins.
--Java and Google Chrome Browser
  https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml

Google Chrome v52.0.2743.82 (64-bit) throws error:
  Java is not working.
 
  To have the best experience joining meetings, Java must be installed on your
  computer and enabled in your browser and the Java Control Panel.  Install
  and enable Java, restart your browser if needed, and then join the meeting
  again.



1. Install java (debian jessie 8.6 amd64):
openjdk-7-doc - OpenJDK Development Kit (JDK) documentation
openjdk-7-jdk - OpenJDK Development Kit (JDK)

# aptitude install openjdk-7-doc
# aptitude install openjdk-7-jdk

$ dpkg -l | grep openjdk-7
openjdk-7-doc
openjdk-7-jdk
openjdk-7-jre
openjdk-7-jre-headless

$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_111"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.6.7) (7u111-2.6.7-1~deb8u1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.111-b01, mixed mode)
$

Looks good.


2. Install Chrome plugin:
