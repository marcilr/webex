together.

o Or see each other's video feeds right next to what you're screen sharing.

o Edit or markup the file you're sharing.

o Or create together from scratch on a shared whiteboard.

Share your screen with your colleagues and work together instantly, no matter
where you are. Explore ideas and move the work ahead.
